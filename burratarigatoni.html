    <h1>Spicy Lemon Rigatoni with Burrata</h1>
    <h3>Prep Time: 15 Minutes               Cook Time: 25 Minutes</h3>
    <p>Last weekend, I saw this excellent video of this Rigatoni pasta with Burrata (@delishaas/TikTok), so I decided to make it myself. </p>
    <p>The recipe was relatively straightforward and took around 15 minutes to prep and 25 minutes to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>1 TBSP olive oil</li>
        <li>3 Shallots, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 TBSP red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
        <li>2 TSP dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 Lemons, juiced (can subsitite 1/3 cup lemon juice)</li>
        <li>Zest from 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 tube sun-dried tomato paste (2.8 oz)</li>
        <li>1 Cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 Cups mixed greens</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>8 oz burrata</li>
        <li>parsley, red pepper flakes to taste</li>
    </ul>

        <li>
            Heat the olive oil in a large pan. Add the shallots, red pepper flakes, basil, oregano,
            lemon zest, and lemon juice; let cook for 1-2 minutes until shallots are golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Add the sun-dried tomato paste to the pan and let cook down for 1-2 minutes.</li>
