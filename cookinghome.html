                Hello cooking world! My name is Chuck Rak and I am a freshman at Pomona College in Claremont, CA.
                I have always loved food and cooking and I decided to start sharing the recipes I make with the
                world for fun. I am by no means an expert cook or anything of the sort, just a guy who loves to cook. 
                Many of these recipes I have found online, and I will try my best to provide credit for them.
            </p>
